# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

##  Overview

This exercise is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

The analysis aims to figure out  if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.


## Results

### Total number of Vine(paid) and non-Vine(unpaid) reviews:
- Total number of paid and helpful reviews: 3
- Total number of unpaid and helpful reviews: 3094

## Summary

### Positivity Bias
- Even if the sample size is small, 2 out 3 paid reviewers ave 5-star ratings. Thus there seems to be some empirical truth to the fact that Vine(paid) reviewers tend to give hihly positive and 5 star ratings.

-### Additional Conclusion
From the numbers of total paid and unpaid reviewrs, it is clear that the number of Vne(paid) reviewers is very small as compared to non-Vine(unpaid) reviewrs. For 3000 non-Vine reviewers, there are only 3 Vine reviews - a ratio of 1 to every 1000 or 0.1%.
